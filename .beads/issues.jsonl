{"id":"otherworlds-rpg-4ln","title":"Implement domain command handlers","description":"Implement command handlers for the 7 domain crates (narrative, rules, world-state, character, inventory, session, content). Each crate has an empty placeholder at src/application/command_handlers.rs. Handlers should accept Commands, validate them, produce DomainEvents, and persist via EventRepository. Follow the event-driven flow: Command -\u003e CommandHandler -\u003e DomainEvent(s) -\u003e EventRepository.append_events(). Use TDD — write failing tests first.","design":"## Narrative Exemplar First\n\nImplement otherworlds-narrative command handlers as the exemplar pattern, then replicate to remaining 6 crates in follow-up.\n\n### Architecture Decisions\n1. Function-based handlers: `async fn handle_*(cmd, \u0026dyn Clock, \u0026dyn EventRepository) -\u003e Result\u003cVec\u003cEvent\u003e, DomainError\u003e`\n2. Aggregate domain methods push events to `uncommitted_events`\n3. `apply()` stays minimal (version increment only)\n4. `apply_stored_event_version_only()` shortcut for reconstitution (full StoredEvent deserialization out of scope)\n5. Sequence number: `version + uncommitted_events.len() + 1`\n6. `causation_id` = `correlation_id` at command-to-event boundary\n\n### Files to Modify\n- `backend/crates/otherworlds-narrative/src/domain/aggregates.rs` — Add `advance_beat()`, `present_choice()` + tests\n- `backend/crates/otherworlds-narrative/src/application/command_handlers.rs` — Add handler fns + mock tests\n- `backend/crates/otherworlds-narrative/Cargo.toml` — Add tokio dev-dep\n\n### TDD Steps\n1. RED/GREEN: `advance_beat()` domain method on `NarrativeSession` → `BeatAdvanced` event\n2. RED/GREEN: `present_choice()` domain method → `ChoicePresented` event\n3. RED/GREEN: `handle_advance_beat()` async handler fn with MockEventRepository\n4. RED/GREEN: `handle_present_choice()` async handler fn\n5. Refactor: clippy, fmt, full test suite\n\n### Tests: 4 total (2 aggregate unit tests + 2 handler unit tests)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"chris.bartling@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-27T22:24:02.067395-06:00","created_by":"Christopher Bartling","updated_at":"2026-02-27T22:59:53.772994-06:00","closed_at":"2026-02-27T22:59:53.772994-06:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"otherworlds-rpg-4ln","depends_on_id":"otherworlds-rpg-6mf","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-27T22:24:13.379423-06:00","created_by":"Christopher Bartling"}]}
