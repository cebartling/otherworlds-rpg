# Otherworlds RPG

## A Manifesto for Deterministic Storytelling

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are many worlds.

Some are imagined.\
Some are remembered.\
Some are recorded.

**Otherworlds RPG** is built on a simple belief:

> A world feels real when it obeys its own laws.

Story does not require chaos.\
Mystery does not require randomness.\
Meaning does not require hidden mechanics.

In Otherworlds, narrative is expressive.\
Outcomes are deterministic.\
The world remembers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Problem

Modern narrative systems often blur essential boundaries:

-   Flavor and mechanics\
-   Author intent and runtime state\
-   Improvisation and resolution

The result is opacity:

-   You don't know why something happened.\
-   You can't reproduce an outcome.\
-   The world feels inconsistent.

Otherworlds rejects that ambiguity.

A living world must have structure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Thesis

Storytelling and systems are not opposites.

A compelling RPG can be:

-   Dialogue-driven\
-   Mechanically transparent\
-   Deterministic\
-   Replayable\
-   Architecturally clean

Otherworlds separates three things:

-   **Engine** --- the deterministic runtime\
-   **Campaign** --- externally authored worlds\
-   **Run** --- the recorded history of a single playthrough

The engine enforces laws.\
The campaign defines possibility.\
The run records consequence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What We Build

We build a system where:

-   Every action is a command.\
-   Every resolution is explicit.\
-   Every outcome becomes a recorded fact.

A persuasion attempt is not narrative magic.\
It is:

-   Intent\
-   Check\
-   Roll\
-   Effect\
-   State transition

And the engine can explain every step.

In Otherworlds, nothing happens without reason.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What We Refuse

We refuse:

-   Hidden mechanics\
-   Undocumented randomness\
-   Implicit state mutation\
-   Story logic buried in code\
-   Engines tightly coupled to content

We do not rely on AI to determine reality.

AI may enrich description.\
It does not adjudicate truth.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Design Principles

### 1. Determinism

If you replay a run with the same inputs, you get the same results.

World state changes only through explicit effects.

### 2. Separation of Worlds

Engine and campaign are independent.

Campaigns are versioned, external, and loadable.

Worlds evolve.\
The engine remains stable.

### 3. Explicit State

Nothing is implied.

Flags, dispositions, factions, quests, items --- all are modeled as
facts.

The world is not a suggestion.\
It is a structured system.

### 4. History as Truth

A campaign run is an ordered sequence of domain events.

This enables:

-   Save and restore\
-   Branching timelines\
-   Replay\
-   Auditable outcomes

Otherworlds remembers because the system remembers.

### 5. Mechanics Before Mystery

Flavor enhances experience.

Mechanics define reality.

Poetry lives on top of structure --- not instead of it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Experience

Otherworlds RPG should feel like sitting at a disciplined tabletop
session:

-   You speak your intent.\
-   The system resolves it transparently.\
-   The world reacts.\
-   The story advances.

It is structured but not rigid.\
Expressive but not chaotic.\
Replayable without becoming mechanical.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Constraint

The engine must remain:

-   Deterministic\
-   Modular\
-   Versioned\
-   Testable\
-   Replayable

If a feature violates these constraints, it does not belong in
Otherworlds.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Vision

Otherworlds RPG is not just a game.

It is:

-   A narrative runtime\
-   A structured simulation of consequence\
-   A system where alternate paths can be explored and replayed\
-   A world governed by laws, not whims

Each campaign is a different world.

Each run is a different history.

The story is authored.\
The mechanics are explicit.\
The world remembers.

And every otherworld follows its own laws.
